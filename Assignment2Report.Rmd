# Data Information

This data contains some information about house information in Antalya. This data contains **25276** rows and **24** columns. Column names and their types are given in the following table:

```{r}
load("house.data")
data <- antalya_train
dataFrame <- data.frame(data)
knitr::kable(sapply(dataFrame, class), col.names = c("Column Types"))
```

There are also some empty values in columns. They are converted to **NA** values. **NA** numbers for each column are given in the following table. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(colSums(is.na(dataFrame)), col.names = c("NA Numbers"))
```

As it can be seen only the "GercekYas" column has NA values.
